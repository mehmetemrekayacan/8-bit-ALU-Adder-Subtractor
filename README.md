# 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Project

This project encompasses the design of an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) circuit, supporting both addition and subtraction operations, along with the corresponding Verilog code. Simulations are provided for Tinkercad and Logicism.

## Features

- 8-bit ALU circuit
- Circuit supporting both addition and subtraction operations
- Simulations on Tinkercad
- Verilog code
